Originally, I was put in charge of the XenServer side of the project, but that
turned out to be too simple. I was done creating that in a few weeks. So from 
there, I went into research mode. The team often worked together and as Kevin 
worked on the HTML files and Alex took on the PHP and some of the Bash, I was 
working in the background keeping them coding. I was kind of the designated 
googler, I found and learned to use the bash commands for copying virtual 
machines and constantly helped the flow of coding during team sessions. I really
enjoyed working with this team and would take on a new project with them any 
time.
