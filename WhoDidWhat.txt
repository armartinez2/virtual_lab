Bob Fenske

Originally, I was put in charge of the XenServer side of the project, but that
turned out to be too simple. I was done creating that in a few weeks. So from 
there, I went into research mode. The team often worked together and as Kevin 
worked on the HTML files and Alex took on the PHP and some of the Bash, I was 
working in the background keeping them coding. I was kind of the designated 
googler, I found and learned to use the bash commands for copying virtual 
machines and constantly helped the flow of coding during team sessions. I really
enjoyed working with this team and would take on a new project with them any 
time.

I worked on both the gateway and the xen server. I wrote all of the
php files for the gateway, as well as the majority of the bash script to 
clone new vms with the help of Bob. Kevin and I worked together on connecting
all of the php and html files. We all worked together to build the web 
interface in xen orchestra. I also did the majority of the work on the database
for the gateway.

Kevin Chlopek

I worked on both the Gateway and the Download of the Xen Server. I wrote all
the HTML files and helped Alex code the PHP along with a small portion of
the bash download for Xenmanager. Alex and I worked through downloading Xen 
Orchestra and then Bob took over figuring out features and how Xen 
Orchestra works especially with controlling users.
